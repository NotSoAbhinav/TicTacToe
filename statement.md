# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

The classic Tic Tac Toe game. This project aims to implement a fully functioning **Minimax-based Tic Tac Toe AI**. 

## Scope of the Project

* Build a console-based Tic Tac Toe game
* Allow a human player to play against the computer
* Integrate the Minimax algorithm for optimal AI gameplay
* Include proper game flow: moves, win detection, draw detection, and replay logic (if needed)

Out of scope:

* Graphical user interface (GUI)
* Online multiplayer components
* Advanced AI enhancements such as pruning or heuristics beyond Minimax
* Mobile or web versions of the game

## Target Users

* Beginners learning Python programming
* Students exploring basic AI concepts
* Developers looking for a minimalistic example of Minimax implementation
* Anyone who wants a simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe opponent

## High-Level Features

* Console-based gameplay using number inputs (1–9)
* Minimax-powered AI that always plays optimally
* Basic input validation (valid moves, empty positions, quit option)
* Automatic win, loss, and draw detection
* Beginner-style source code with minimal structural complexity
